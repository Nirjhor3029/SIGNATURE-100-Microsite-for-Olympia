                    Why is it sustainable to shift to forest-based materials?
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Conventional plastics are made from non-renewable sources.
                    To not exploit these sources SIG has launched its SIGNATURE
                    portfolio. SIGNATURE 100 is designed for the highest
                    renewable share of 100% linked to mass-balance. All plastics
                    used, including the closure, to manufacture the pack are
                    linked to renewable forest-based materials. The main
                    material of the SIGNATURE 100 is carton-board. The
                    paperboard used comes from socially and environmentally
                    responsible forestry, which complies with the Forest
                    Stewardship CouncilTM (FSC<sup>TM</sup>) standards.

                    <br />
                    The FSC<sup>TM</sup> label informs consumers about a
                    responsible sourcing of wood material during the
                    manufacturing process of a product. Check out the FSC<sup

                    Offering an alu-free packaging while ensuring highest
                    standards to food quality is challenging as the aluminium
                    layer provides protection from light, oxygen and maintains
                    the product's aroma, The SIGNATURE 100 is designed
                    specifically for white UHT milk. It is the world's first
                    alu-free beverage carton linked to 100% forest-based
                    plastics. The elimination of the aluminium layer reduces the
                    carton's carbon footprint. Check out the CO, reduction

                <p>
                    We want more people to make recycling part of their routine
                    to help keep high quality materials in circulation, prevent
                    valuable natural resources going to waste and avoid
                    environmental impacts from landfill.
                    <br />
                    Every part of a beverage carton can be recycled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The paper fibres that make up around 75% of each beverage
                    carton remain long, strong and high-quality even after they
                    are recovered from used cartons. The small amounts of
                    polymer and aluminium from cartons can be recycled together
                    to make hard-wearing products like roof tiles and garden
                    furniture.
